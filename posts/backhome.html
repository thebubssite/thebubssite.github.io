            <p>Yeah….it’s been a while since I wrote anything and Michael’s written like the last three entries in the last month so I thought I might as well write something. I’ve been quite busy studying cs since I’ve been back and I’ve been enjoying it although some  parts are quite hard for my feeble mind. I think I might switch my major to cs but we will see how first semester goes first. I am actually quite excited to start college at Berkeley and I am hoping it gets here quicker cause I feel impatient. Yes, I know, I was kind of intimidated by orientation day, but I realize I have to challenge myself and I have to get out of my comfort zone. It is the fear of the unknown of how Berkeley is going to be that is scaring me, but the unknown is nothing to be afraid of. Just another adventure and it’s gonna be great.

            <p>I also didn’t like cal engineering because it didn’t allow much time for elective courses that I wanted to take and explore my interests as I heard there were many great courses. But then I realized I don’t want to take those courses. Why would I want to take a course and do homework on it while I can just watch the interesting lectures online with no obligation? So yeah, in Berkeley I won’t have as many free classes to take but I will just take the ones I really want to take and there are so many good lectures online. I started watching this lecture on Political Philosophy and it was very good. He started off with an example of if we were driving a train and we saw five people on the tracks on the track we were headed. But you saw that there was a split in the tracks that you could change so that you would only kill one construction worker instead. And most people said they would swerve and kill the one person instead, because its better to save five lives and kill one then to save one life and kill five. Then he made another example where this time you were on a bridge on top of the train tracks and you saw the train was going to kill five people on the tracks. However, next to you, is a very fat man on the bridge. You could either let the train go by and kill five people, or push the fat man off the bridge and the train will run into him and stop the train so the five people live. And now no one said they would push the man off the bridge. Even though by their previous reasoning that it is better to save five lives rather than one and both ways you are choosing to kill someone. It was quite interesting and I think I’m going to keep watching it. I don’t need to be enrolled in a class to learn about philosophy or psychology and I think I was very happy when I had that epiphany since I think in addition to learning about stuff related to your job it’s also important to indulge your interests and electives.</p>

            <p>I got a new laptop and phone as most of you fools know and it’s like I’m a completely different person. I really like my laptop and it’s very nice. It can even turn into a tablet and it’s touchscreen so it’s pretty sick.</p>

            <p>It’s been really fun seeing you guys again although Michael is gone doing who knows what. I’m going to Vegas next week for nationals though so I’ll see you guys next week probably.</p>

            <p>Some Quotes that really stuck with me</p>

            <p>“Don’t get mad. Don’t get even. Do better. Become so engulfed in your own success that you forget it ever happened. ” -Anonymous</p>

            <p>“So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect, so we never dare to ask the universe for it…My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn’t believe that was possible for him, and so he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant, and when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job and our family had to do whatever we could to survive.</p>

            <p>I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.” – Jim Carrey</p>
