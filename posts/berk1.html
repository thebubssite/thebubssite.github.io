              <p>Hey guys,</p>

              <p>So I just finished my first week in berk. It was fun. My roomate is exactly like will guys, just a litte bit smarter. IDK if you have seen my snapchats but he pretty much just plays Video games. Funny enough his research is in like virtural reality. I have been having this thought that people who are really into games are seperate from their true reality. So much so that the game has become their sudo reality to avoid the harsh truths of real life. I belive Jimi is intersted in VR as a way to escape the real world if the tech ever become realvant.</p>

              <p>Anyhow, the first week of bootcamp was ok. We had like 8 hour days inside this like one room, with like just us 8 guys in their which was interesting. The people in Ihouse are generally nice, it is pretty easy to catch a conversation with one of them. I have this guy in the program, Andy, who is a true extrovert and is always able to talk with people easily. I have been hanging with him as an attempt to meet people through the guy.</p>

              <p>I have had time to go to the gym and stuff. If only I had a certain someone to spot me. Some one whose name rymths with mevanâ€¦.</p>

              <p>We havent really started research yet but we will this next week. I hope its fun man. And ill also get the opportunity to network with some people hopefully so that will be good as well. The more I think about it I am extremly lucky to be here. I will make sure to give my all as i begin this new part of my life.</p>

              <p>If you guys ever want to skype just message me, ill always be able to find time if you guys want to. And if you really want to have fun you guys can drive up here and see me in person.</p>

              <p>But either way we will have a week when I come back to hang and smoke whatever.</p>

               

              Stay chill,

              Michael
