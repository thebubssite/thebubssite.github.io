            <p>Well here we are again. I have been thinking, but more like just having fun up here. So I’ve been sleeping in her room and its pretty cool. I talked to her and we decided that its cool just having this summer thing then going our separate ways once the summer is over. Im kinda torn about whether to be happy or sad about this, but she is gone for the weekend so maybe Ill get some other action.</p>

            <p>Other then that development, I am starting to get bored with my research, my research compared to other people is slow and repetitive. The more I do it the less I want to even be there. So most of the time I just listen to videos, or chance the rapper in the background. Man i didn’t know chance was so good I legit listen to him so often nowadays. My mentor was gone these last two weeks so the last to weeks were kinda depressing because I didn’t really have anyone to talk to or get feedback with.</p>

            <p>However, I did talk to this guy jeff in my lab and he was pretty cool. He actually introduced me another lab and even offered to introduce me to many other ones as well. Because my  lab is mostly theoretical it can get kinda boring, but the other labs were experiment which can be cooler. Its the difference between talking about experiments/modeling, and actually doing them.</p>

            <p>(p.s. sleeping in the same bed with someone else is actually the least comfortable way to sleep… no lie)</p>
